     Apparentely the +7/+4/-7/-4 data in the above link was wrong and screwed up the heatmaps.


   Camera is a subrectangle of Map

   (left, bottom, right, top)

   e.g on
 
   -- Cloud Kingdom LE --

   camera = (25, 44, 137, 168)
   map = ( 0,  0, 160, 208) 
   
   -- Ohana LE --

   camera = (24, 17, 137, 151)
   map = ( 0,  0, 160, 184)
